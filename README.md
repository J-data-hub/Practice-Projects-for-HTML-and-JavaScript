# Practice-Projects-for-HTML-and-JavaScript
I am a newby with a strong interest in web development. My expectations are to gain knowledge from others and hands on experience
in my journey to discover the world of web developement.  I intend to host projects so that I may
learn by doing here at git-hub.  Thank you for your interest and support. With the current HTML file and its associated
.js file, I am trying to learn how to exploit local storage to save what I intend to be an array of items entered
in a todo list application.  Clearly, at the moment both the .html and the .js files are in their early
stages of development.
